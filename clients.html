        Candy, Jonty and Loris did an amazing job on our NamKhan Project & Ecolodge property.
For 2 weeks they were very professional, adapting to our booking schedule, weather conditions and staff presence. I would highly recommend the Candy and the King team as they were incredible, their work resulted in additional bookings, increased social media exposure and social media skills. Not only did they create significant numbers of photos and videos, but they also conducted training sessions for our team regarding social media.
<br>
It was a real pleasure to have the chance to have you with us, we will definitely keep in touch and will use your services again in the future.<br>

        <br>
        Dear Candy,
        <br><br>
        I just wanted to express my sincere thanks for the social media training you delivered recently. I found it really informative and helpful for my future business page.
        <br>
        The apps you recommended along with your expert guidance have given me skills to be able to produce some truly wonderful photos and publish them in an aesthetically pleasing way.
        <br>
        I now understand the algorithms of instagram, the importance of #hashtags and the most beneficial time to post for maximum engagement.
        <br>
        Thank you so much, I really look forward to professionalising my business page and reaching a wider network.
        <br><br>
        Much gratitude<br>

        For the last month, Candy and Jonty worked with us at Maison Dalabua, Manda de Laos and Gaspard. As the social media manager for all businesses, their strategies and inside tips have definitely stepped up our online presence. They are very talented at what they do and lovely, hardworking people!

          We at Ch√¢teau Orientale in Luang Phabang had the pleasure to accommodate Candy and the King for a couple of days.
          The team of three shot videos and took pictures to help us to promote our a bit remote located Resort and Restaurant. We had a wonderful time and I've enjoyed the friendliness of the small group. I absolutely recommend them as a humble and honest team! I hope they will succeed further and   enjoy their time in. Laos or neighbouring countries.

          In 2016, Candy and Jonty helped me turn my passion into a career. We brainstormed together and got all my ideas out on paper which was the beginning of my fitness business, CazFit. (I still have that piece of paper we scribbled all my ideas on.) They also did some corporate branding for me (I have 4 pages of different logo designs she helped me with, they also designed my double-sided business cards and my invoice template). <br>Their work ethic went above and beyond my expectations, and Candy made herself available to my requests at all hours. <br> I also hired them to consult me with my social media pages. After  helping me setup my business Facebook page and Instagram page, they taught me the basics of social media management so I have been able to manage my accounts myself. <br>Their service really is incredible and I'm definitely going to be going to them to redesign my website. I wouldn't go to anyone else! üòÅ  <br>

During the four months, they did corporate branding that included business cards for all my office staff, a letterhead, email signatures, social media icons and many more branded stationary items. <br> They also managed my business Facebook page which did very well under their care.<br>
