        Candy and the King built our JP Residences website and the result was perfect and exactly what we expected. It's clear, modern and easy to navigate.

          Candy and Jonty are both amazing at what they do. From the initial call right through to the handover of our brand new website, they were so informative and kept us updated every step of the way. They made amazing suggestions that we‚Äôd have never thought of and we felt like they truly understood exactly we were going for.

          King Code completely changed my life. They built a customized website for me from scratch. We met on zoom for the first time and I briefly told them what my vision was and they completely made it come true. They also helped me come up with content ideas for my Instagram which I am so thankful for. I honestly wouldn't choose anyone else to build my website and be a part of my team! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>

            I needed a fresh website where I could bring people to my email list, send people to my other social channels, and encourage my community to buy my ebooks and merch. King Code was able to put all of that in one place for me. They took my fun and energetic style and turned it into a beautiful and professional site. I learned from Candy and Jonty about launching in phases instead of launching everything all at once. You don't just get a beautiful website, you also get coaching and lessons that will last a lifetime! After I launched my first phase, I gained over 100 email subscribers within a week. I was gaining maybe 8-10 subscribers every month. I made 10 new sales within a month, and previous to that I had made 2 sales over 3 months. You can't beat the service either. I had one thing I wanted Candy to change after the launch and it was done within 3 hours, and we are in completely opposite time zones! I am so happy that I decided to invest in myself and King Code because I know I am going to grow faster and stronger because of my custom coded website.<br>

        Candy and Jonty took my website to another level ü•∞ I turned my hobby into a business which meant I needed to upgrade my website. In search of doing so, I found The Kings and decided to have them build me a custom-made website because I wanted my website to stick out from all the rest of the websites. I gave them an idea of what I wanted and they created a website more than I could have envisioned (and may I add that they did so in so little time). I'm absolutely in love with the results. Besides being so professional, Jonty and Candy are very kind, and patient, and are continuously available to answer any question I have even after the website handover.<br>

        Dude, where do I even begin? Not only do Candy and Jonty care about my business goals but they also care about me on a personal level which makes them that much cooler than they already are. After having a brainstorming sesh with Candy in Kenya (yes! I went on her social media retreat!), she started on my website for Ink and Dash the next day and completely blew my mind. She basically knew me better than I know myself! And Jonty is one in a million. Always sharing his brilliant ideas and  being so excited. Thank you so much King Code for everything. I can't wait to see where this new journey takes me and I know you'll have my back the entire way. 20/10 would recommend ‚ô° <br>

        Dear Candy,
        <br><br>
        I just wanted to express my sincere thanks for the social media training you delivered recently. I found it really informative and helpful for my future business page.
        <br>
        The apps you recommended along with your expert guidance have given me skills to be able to produce some truly wonderful photos and publish them in an aesthetically pleasing way.
        <br>
        I now understand the algorithms of instagram, the importance of #hashtags and the most beneficial time to post for maximum engagement.
        <br>
        Thank you so much, I really look forward to professionalising my business page and reaching a wider network.

      <h3> Website Design & Website Development </h3>
      <p> We've coded websites for businesses and personal blogs. From "Save the Dates" and online wedding invitations to corporates. Their sites are built using multiple coding languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Our clients receive a client management system (CMS) that allows them to edit their websites without having any experience in coding.  </p>
