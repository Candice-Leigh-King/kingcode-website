        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>We're not just developers, but also have a decade of experience in marketing &amp; entrepreneurship and know what it takes for a website to tell a story about your brand and convert.&nbsp; </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-3_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2 editable">
        <h3> Web Design</h3>
        <p>80% of your website traffic will likely be on a mobile, so we build everything to be just as stunning and impactful on small devices as it is on big-ones, resulting in a thoughtfully created mobile experience.&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-3_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2 editable">
        <h3>Content Creation</h3>
        <p>We don't use any pre-made templates or clunky themes (which often slow your site down) -- we built everything from scratch in modern, reliable code. You deserve a site that reflects your brand, not something off-the-shelf.&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-3_sm-6_xs-12 padded-2 editable" >
        <h3>Social Media Management</h3>
        <p>All our sites come custom-integrated with the most user-friendly CMS that our clients love! Everything is customised to your needs, and comes with video tutorials and personal support to make sure you're confident updating your site.</p>
