         <h4 class="editable">What is a hybrid template? </h4>
        <div class="panel1">
          <p class="editable">A hybrid template is a combination of a custom-coded website and a regular template. Since all regular templates run extremely slowly and have a handful of security issues, we decided to take ONLY the good and necessary elements of a template and build it in the same way we build custom-coded websites.

      <div class="accordion4 col-12">
        <div class="accordion">
           <h4 class="editable">Is a hybrid template faster than a WordPress Template?</h4>
        <div class="panel4">
          <p class="editable">Yes. The reason templates hosted on WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, etc are so slow is due to all the additional code and extra features that come with those hosting platforms to make sure the template covers almost every single client. Although this sounds good in theory, the reality is that on average, you will only use 45% of those features on your site. This means your site is loading code that you aren't even using, and it also means that there is unnecessary script linked to unknown backend sources slowing down your website and making it easier to hack. A hybrid template is designed specifically for a single clienttell, therefore there are only feautures that you will NEED in your industry. This speeds up your website performance by more than 4 times. A hybrid template is also a lot easier to edit and is more user-friendly since the features available to you are only the ones you need. Since custom-code is at the core of our templates, you'll be able to scale your website very easily in the future as your business grows by adding other functionalities like a blog, shop or portfolio. You will also have access to additional features like Google Analytics, Google Ads, Instagram grid loader (loads your most recent IG photos), and any other feature you wish with NO plugin at all (just a small fee). </p>
