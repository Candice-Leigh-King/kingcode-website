        <h1 class="col-12 centered">Website Hosting Plans</h1>
        <p class="col-9_xs-12 bg-white padded ">All of our custom-coded websites and website templates come with an incredibly easy-to-use content management system (CMS) or better known as web builder that allows you to login, and make updates to your website with absolute ease. Even the least tech savvy people have a breeze creating new pages, editing current pages, adding/removing images, blogging, adding products, etc.
       <br> <br><span class="card-subheading">And the best part? Our website hosting plans are a set price for all website types. This means, whether you have an online shop, blog, portfolio, a personal or business website, your hosting fee stays the same. YIP! <b>We don't charge you more if you have a shop or blog</b> like other CMSs or web builders and hosts (if you've read their small print, you'll know exactly what we're talking about). This makes scaling your business affordable. </span>
       <br><br>The CMS that we use (CloudCannon) is trusted by 40,000+ others and is also used to manage Netflix microsties. In other words, <b>your website will be hosted on the same platfrom that Netflix uses!</b><br> <br>Since our websites are unhackable, <b>we guarantee that your site will never go down or get hacked. </b> </p>
