      <h3> Photography </h3>
      <p> What is a photographer? We like to think of ourselves as painters with very expensive paintbrushes. A visual storyteller some might also say. With an image, you have less than a second to capture someone's attention. With every photo we are able to teleport the viewer into an atmosphere that we've captured. Clean and beautiful imagery has the potential to activate all senses, and this is our speciality. Whether it's lifestyle photography, hotel photography, food photography, travel photography or portrait photography we are the Kings.</p>

      <h3> Videography </h3>
      <p> A successfully produced video, is one of the most effective types of content in today's world. Why? A video is far more eye-catching than graphics, images or text. Capture a viewer's attention for 3 seconds, there's a 75% chance they'll stay for 10 seconds, and a 40% chance they'll stay for 30 seconds. Whether you are involved in tourism, products, hotels, restaurants or even gardening, you need videos.</p>
