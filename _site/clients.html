        Candy, Jonty and Loris did an amazing job on our NamKhan Project & Ecolodge property. For 2 weeks they were very professional, adapting to our booking schedule, weather conditions and staff presence. I would highly recommend the Candy and the King team as they were incredible, their work resulted in additional bookings, increased social media exposure and social media skills. Not only did they create significant numbers of photos and videos, but they also conducted training sessions for our team regarding social media.<br> It was a real pleasure to have the chance to have you with us, we will definitely keep in touch and will use your services again in the future.<br>

        Dude, where do I even begin? Not only do Candy and Jonty care about my business goals but they also care about me on a personal level which makes them that much cooler than they already are. After having a brainstorming sesh with Candy in Kenya (yes! I went on her social media retreat!), she started on my website for Ink and Dash the next day and completely blew my mind. She basically knew me better than I know myself! And Jonty is one in a million. Always sharing his brilliant ideas and  being so excited. Thank you so much King Code for everything. I can't wait to see where this new journey takes me and I know you'll have my back the entire way. 20/10 would recommend ♡ <br>

        I just wanted to express my sincere thanks for the social media training you delivered recently. I found it really informative and helpful for my future business page.
        <br>
        The apps you recommended along with your expert guidance have given me skills to be able to produce some truly wonderful photos and publish them in an aesthetically pleasing way.

        I now understand the algorithms of instagram, the importance of #hashtags and the most beneficial time to post for maximum engagement.

        Thank you so much, I really look forward to professionalising my business page and reaching a wider network.

          In 2016, Candy and Jonty helped me turn my passion into a career. We brainstormed together and got all my ideas out on paper which was the beginning of my fitness business, CazFit. (I still have that piece of paper we scribbled all my ideas on.) They also did some corporate branding for me (I have 4 pages of different logo designs she helped me with, they also designed my double-sided business cards and my invoice template). <br>Their work ethic went above and beyond my expectations, and Candy made herself available to my requests at all hours. <br> I also hired them to consult me with my social media pages. After  helping me setup my business Facebook page and Instagram page, they taught me the basics of social media management so I have been able to manage my accounts myself. <br>Their service really is incredible and I'm definitely going to be going to them to redesign my website.
